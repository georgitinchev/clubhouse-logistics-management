# Media Bazaar Logistics Management System

## About

I led a team to develop a **Media Bazaar Logistics System** using **C# .NET**. The system includes role-based user management, stock tracking, and task allocation modules to optimize logistics operations. Key features include:
- **Role-based User Management**: Different user roles for managing system access and functionality (Security Guard, Depot Worker, Sales Rep, Department Manager).
- **Stock Tracking**: Efficient inventory management with real-time stock updates.
- **Task Allocation**: A system for assigning and managing tasks among employees.
- **Admin Statistics**: Admin-specific reports for analyzing performance and system usage, helping to improve operational efficiency and team collaboration.

This project is designed to streamline logistics operations, improve communication among departments, and enhance overall productivity.
